Developed by [Florian Eckerstorfer](https://florian.ec) in Vienna, Europe.


Features
--------

Plum is a data processing pipeline, that means it reads data, filters and converts it and then writes the data.

- Filters, converters and even writers are pipeline elements that can be attached to a workflow in arbitrary order
- Readers are iterators that can return values of arbitrary type: arrays, objects or scalars, it doesn't matter to Plum
- Conditional converters that are only applied to an item if it passes a filter
- Ability to concatenate workflow to create smaller and better reusable workflows
- Read from multiple sources, i.e., merge data from different sources into an output
- Plums power comes from its extendability, check out [additional packages and integrations](docs/extensions.md)

*Plum has been greatly inspired by [ddeboer/data-import](https://github.com/ddeboer/data-import).*


Usage
-----

Here is a quick preview, but please check out the
[documentation](https://github.com/plumphp/plum/blob/master/docs/index.md).

```php
use Plum\Plum\Workflow;

$workflow = new Workflow();
$workflow->addFilter(/* filter */)
         ->addConverter(/* converter */)
         ->addWriter(/* writer */);
$workflow->process(/* reader */);
```


Installation
------------

You can install Plum using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) (recommended) or by downloading a
